<h2>"Need For Efficiency In Agriculture- More Than Ever!"</h2>
<h3>Agriculture to Farm-Easy :</h3>
</p>

<div>
<p> Trends, Challenges, and the Path Forward with Digital Technology and Software Solutions, we projected that the agriculture industry
    would feed an estimated global population of 9.7 billion by 2050. In 2020 alone, a 60% increase is required to feed the population. We talked about macroeconomics, 
   changing consumer preferences, emerging technologies and transforming supply chains as the key drivers for digital transformation in agriculture and how the
    challenges facing the agriculture industry worldwide could be effectively tackled by following the right approach and leveraging technology to meet the growing 
   demand for food.</p>

<p>
    Until now, factors such as climate change, population growth and food security concerns have propelled the industry into seeking more innovative approaches to
     improve crop yield. But the current COVID-19 crisis has further exposed the vulnerability of the agricultural landscape and raised questions about meeting the global 
    food demands sustainably, with adverse factors at play. Again, the answer lies in achieving efficiency- producing more with less, now more than ever.</p>
<p>We in India raising the "SAVE SOIL" campaign as the quality of soil is much degraded in last 2 decades.,
    Keeping these things in mind our thought is
    
      “The industry will be transformed by data science and artificial intelligence. Farmers will have the tools to get the most from every acre.”</p>
